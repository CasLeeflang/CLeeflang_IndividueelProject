     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[TimeSlot].[BusinessuserId] is being dropped, data loss could occur.
       The column [dbo].[TimeSlot].[BusinessId] on table [dbo].[TimeSlot] must be added, but the column has no default value
         and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must
         either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults
         as a deployment option.
       The type for column EndTime in table [dbo].[TimeSlot] is currently  VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL but is being changed to 
         DATETIME NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with
         type  DATETIME NOT NULL.
       The type for column StartTime in table [dbo].[TimeSlot] is currently  VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL but is being changed to 
         DATETIME NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with
         type  DATETIME NOT NULL.
